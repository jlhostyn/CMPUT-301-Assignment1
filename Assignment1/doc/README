	The app will show up as jlhostyn-as1 on the emulator and the inluded apk is Assignment1.apk.
The UML diagram is called as1UML.PNG too in /doc. I unfortunately ran out of time and didn't get a chance
to implement claims being able to have a status (submitted,returned,approved,in progress) but I
have implemented every other requirement.
